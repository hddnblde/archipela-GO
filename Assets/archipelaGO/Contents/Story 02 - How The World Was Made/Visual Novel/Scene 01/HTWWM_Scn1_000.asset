      m_text: Thousand of years ago, there was no land nor sun nor moon nor stars,
        and the world was only a great sea of water, above which stretched the sky.
        The water was the kingdom of the god, Maguayan, and the great god, Captan,
        ruled the sky.
    - m_voiceOver: {fileID: 0}
      m_text: Maguayan had a daughter called Lidagat, the sea, and Captan had a son
        known as Lihangin, the wind. The gods agreed to the marriage of their children,
        so the sea became the bride of the wind.
    - m_voiceOver: {fileID: 0}
      m_text: Three sons and a daughter were born to them. The sons were called Licalibutan,
        Liadlao, and Libulan, and the daughter received the name of Lisuga.

      m_text: "Maguayan, I\u2019m so ecstatic. Look at these adorable children! Lidagat
        and Lihangin surely know how to make marvelous offsprings!"

      m_text: Haha! I agree, Captan. Look at Licalibutan. He has a body of rock,
        so strong and brave. Then Liadlao, formed of gold, is undoubtedly a jolly
        one.

      m_text: "Libulan, our grandson made of copper, looks timid, though. Hopefully,
        he gets past that attitude so he could be stronger. And\r ahh, of course,
        our lovely Lisuga."

      m_text: Our sweet and gentle granddaughter. Her silver radiance and form really
        suits her.

      m_text: "I couldn\u2019t agree more, especially, as I see both our Lidagat
        and Lihangin being also happy by having this family."
