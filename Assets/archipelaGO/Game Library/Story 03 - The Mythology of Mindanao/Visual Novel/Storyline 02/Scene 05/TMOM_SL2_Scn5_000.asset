      m_text: Sulayman then traveled to Matutun. There, he witnessed even more devastation
        and a more {dreadful} state of affairs. He was standing on the mountain when
        he heard a noise in the forest and noticed movement in the trees. Tarabusaw
        appeared soon after, drew close, and let out a loud yell.

      m_text: Tarabusaw snatched large branches from the trees and attacked Sulayman
        as it said these words. The struggle lasted a long time until the animal
        became exhausted and collapsed to the ground. With a {steady} hand, Sulayman
        struck Tarabusaw with his sword and instantly killed it. As the animal was
        dying, it looked up to him and said a few words.
