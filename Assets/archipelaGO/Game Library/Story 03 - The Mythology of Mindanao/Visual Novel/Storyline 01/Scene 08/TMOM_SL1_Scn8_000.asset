      m_text: Indarapatra passed on Mount Bita and resumed his search for Raja Sulayman.
        There he saw the dead bird lying on the ground, and as he lifted the severed
        wing, he saw the bones of Sulayman and recognized them by means of the sword
        that was lying by their side.

      m_text: Raising his head, Indarapatra turned around and saw a small jar of
        water near him. He knew that the jar was sent down from heaven, so he took
        it and poured its water on the bones of his brother, and his brother came
        to life again.
