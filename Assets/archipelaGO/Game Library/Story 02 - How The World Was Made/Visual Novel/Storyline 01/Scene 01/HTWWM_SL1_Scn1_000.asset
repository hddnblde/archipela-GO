      m_text: Thousand of years ago, there was no land nor sun nor moon nor stars,
        and the world was only a great sea of water, above which stretched the sky.
        The water was the kingdom of the god, Maguayan, and the great god, Captan,
        ruled the sky.
    - m_voiceOver: {fileID: 0}
      m_text: Maguayan had a daughter called Lidagat, the sea, and Captan had a son
        known as Lihangin, the wind. The gods agreed to the marriage of their children,
        so the sea became the bride of the wind.
    - m_voiceOver: {fileID: 0}
      m_text: Three sons and a daughter were born to them. The sons were called Licalibutan,
        Liadlao, and Libulan, and the daughter received the name of Lisuga.
