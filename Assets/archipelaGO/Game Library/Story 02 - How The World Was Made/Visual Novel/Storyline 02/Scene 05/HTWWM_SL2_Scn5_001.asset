      m_text: The brothers dashed into the opening, only to be met by the enraged
        god  Captan. He was so angered by the incident that he sent three lightning
        bolts  after the three brothers. The first strike melted the copper Libulan
        and formed it  into a ball. The second hit the golden Liadlao, melting him
        as well. The third bolt  hit Licalibutan, causing his rocky body to {shatter}
        and fall into the sea.
